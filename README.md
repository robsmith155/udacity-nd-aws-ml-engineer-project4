# udacity-nd-aws-ml-engineer-project4
Repo for project 4 of the [Udacity AWS ML Engineer nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/aws-machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd189). Here we are given some code ready for deployment by Udacity and need to demonstrate running in various ways, including:

- Train and deploy model using SageMaker (via `train_and_deply-solution.ipynb` notebook).
- Train the same model using an EC2 instance (use the code in `ec2train1.py` for this).
- Create Lambda function to invoke deployed model (code in `lambdafunction.py)

I may add instructions for how to run on SageMaker and EC2 instance at a later date, but this wadn't the most useful of projects. You can find a summary and comments in the `writeup.pdf` file.
